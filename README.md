##1. Image Classification using CNN with TensorFlow | CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the CIFAR-10 dataset, implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 categories, such as airplanes, cars, birds, and animals. The goal is to build a robust CNN model that can classify unseen test images with high accuracy.


2. Project Overview

The main components of this project include:

Loading and preprocessing image data

Designing a Convolutional Neural Network architecture

Compiling and training the model

Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Visualizing training and validation accuracy over epochs


This implementation is beginner-friendly and well-structured, making it ideal for anyone learning computer vision or TensorFlow/Keras.


3. Dataset

This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is publicly available and can be automatically loaded using TensorFlow.

Classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck

Images: 60,000 total (50,000 for training, 10,000 for testing)


- Download from: [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- Automatically loaded using TensorFlow/Keras API


4. Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow and Keras

NumPy, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

5. Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:

Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation and MaxPooling

A Flatten layer to convert 2D feature maps into a 1D feature vector

One Dense (fully connected) hidden layer

A Dense output layer with softmax activation for multiclass classification


This architecture is designed to balance model complexity with training efficiency.


6. Results

After training the model for 10 epochs, it achieves approximately 70â€“75% accuracy on the test dataset. Results may vary slightly depending on system performance and random initialization.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Training vs. Validation Accuracy Plot


7. How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-image-classification.git
cd cnn-image-classification
2. Open the notebook or script in Google Colab or your local Python environment.
3. Run all cells. The CIFAR-10 dataset will be downloaded automatically by TensorFlow.



8. Optional: Dataset Hosting

If you use a larger or custom dataset:

Host it on platforms like Google Drive, Kaggle, or Dropbox

Provide the public download link in the README

Use scripts (e.g., gdown or wget) to programmatically download it
